[["survival-analysis.html", "4 Survival analysis 4.1 Proportional hazard models", " 4 Survival analysis 4.1 Proportional hazard models In proportional hazard models, we assume that the hazard for one category is proportional to the hazard in another. The hazard (\\(h(t)\\)) here is basically the chance of dying for an individual. If \\(S(t)\\) is the survival function, it is equal to: \\[\\begin{equation} h(t) = -\\frac{S&#39;(t)}{S(t)} \\end{equation}\\] which is the same as: \\[\\begin{equation} h(t) = -\\frac{\\text{d}\\text{log}(S(t)}{\\text{d}t} \\end{equation}\\] We can integrate both sides: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_0^T h(t)\\text{d}t = -\\int_0^T \\frac{\\text{d}\\text{log}(S(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\text{d}t \\end{equation}\\] By realizing that \\(S(0)=1\\), this can be rearranged to be: \\[\\begin{equation} S(T) = e^{-\\int_0^T h(t)dt} \\end{equation}\\] What does this mean? Firstly, let’s say there is no hazard: \\[\\begin{equation} S(T) = e^{-\\int_0^T 0 dt} = 1, \\end{equation}\\] then everyone always survives. Let’s assume there’s a constant hazard, C: \\[\\begin{equation} S(T) = e^{-\\int_0^T C dt} = e^{-C\\cdot T}, \\end{equation}\\] now the surviving fraction declines exponentially. Under the proportional hazards model, the assumption is that the hazard function of one category is proportional to the hazard in another, e.g.: \\[\\begin{equation} h_2(t) = b\\cdot h_1(t). \\end{equation}\\] If we assume the hazard rate to be constant and set: \\[\\begin{equation} h_1(t) = C, \\end{equation}\\] we can see how this plays out in the survival rate: \\[\\begin{align} S_1(t) &amp;= e^{-C\\cdot t}\\\\ S_2(t) &amp;= e^{-b\\cdot C \\cdot t} = \\left(e^{-C \\cdot t}\\right)^b \\end{align}\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
